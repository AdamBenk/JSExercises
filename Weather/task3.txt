New tasks:

1. refactor arrow component, 
- 1 component is responsible for 1 arrow! so your component will be more versatile
- you can set container element
- it has render
- it triggers an event, when clicked, so other components can subscribe to it
- render method: renders component into its container

2. create an overlay component that will display a progress icon while operations happens (load data from server, etc.)
   and it hides all the screen.
- it has a container property that is the container element of it
- render method
- it has a show method that displays it
- hide method that hide it
