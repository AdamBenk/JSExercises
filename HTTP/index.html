    Make a login page with username and password fields and a login button.
    When the user clicks the login button, make an AJAX request to the server to check if the username and password are correct.

    the url is GET http://localhost:3002/login

    the server works very badly, sometimes it takes 5s to respond, sometimes it results error on server
    and sometimes it works fine. You have to handle all the cases.
    When ajax request timeouts, open a small window on screen and ask the user to try again.
    When ajax request results error on server, open a small window on screen and ask the user to try again.
    When ajax request results success, open a small window on screen and show the user a welcome message.
    When successfully logged in, then redirect to the home page.

   Tasks:
   - implement the login page with username and password fields and a login button

   - implement Request.js to make the ajax request, use the previous Request.js from DOM4
       - for POST requests, parameters need to be sent in HTTP request body
           - for this server, you need to send the parameters in JSON format:
               {
                   "username": "user",
                   "password": "pass"
               }
       - implement Request.js, so it handles timeouts, and server errors
         Each case make request.js object to throw an error

   - implement error handling in the login page
       - when ajax request timeouts, open a small window on screen and ask the user to try again.
       - when ajax request results error on server, open a small window on screen and ask the user to try again.
       - when ajax request results success, open a small window on screen and show the user a welcome message.
       - when successfully logged in, then redirect to the home page.

   - when needed, create new classes for each component on screen, but you can use html only.
